# 15 — Roster and invitations: Screen handoff

**Status:** Ready for owner brief. **Owner's requested change:** Not yet supplied.
**Current screen only:** Roster and invitations.
**Route/view:** `/club — Roster and Private invitations panels`
**Related tracker IDs:** M4-8, M4-9, M5-5. Verify current canonical evidence before closing any item.

## Start instruction for the next chat/turn

Work on **Roster and invitations only**. Read [00-WORKING-STANDARD.md](00-WORKING-STANDARD.md), this handoff, applicable AGENTS.md and CONTRIBUTING.md. Ask the owner what they want changed on this screen if the brief has not already been supplied. Do not ask them to reconstruct the earlier audit. First inspect the existing implementation and applicable states; then carry the agreed reversible local work through verification and review.

This document is a screen work package, not blanket implementation/publication/activation approval. Do not create a separate chat unless the owner requests it.

## Screen contract

Existing members/guests, roster aliases, captain self-tag and private invitation controls.

## What must remain correct

Membership, invite lifecycle, guest claiming and revocation are permission-sensitive. Do not create users/invites, broaden access, publish member lists or infer captain scoring exclusivity.

Shared contracts: team/season/game isolation; established scoring/credits/rule versions; current authorization; truthful Saved/offline/error states; sample versus connected separation; accessible keyboard/touch navigation and return context.

## Version and review target

Baseline source: main `4790f19b7fec25971dfd9490675c3f56905dbdf6` / PR #11, verified October 23, 2026. Recheck the current branch, working tree and remote main before edits.

Record whether the owner is reviewing a local preview, inactive candidate or live site. PR #11's last receipt says its candidate is inactive; this pack did not refresh provider traffic. The live screen may differ from merged code. Keep Error 1102/capacity work distinct from visual acceptance.

## Existing code to inspect and reuse

- `src/app/club/page.tsx`
- `src/components/club-form.tsx`
- `src/app/club/actions.ts`

These are verified file paths in the inspected worktree. Trace imports/data contracts as needed rather than assuming this list is the entire dependency graph. Shared-file changes require checking their other consumers.

## Focused acceptance cases

Check isolated creator/member/guest/claimed/inactive fixtures, expired/revoked/used invite presentation, denial states, privacy and long names. Hosted invitation/revocation tests need named accounts/actions first.

Also apply the working standard's relevant empty/loading/error/offline/permission, narrow-screen, long-text, keyboard/focus and adjacent-navigation checks. Use synthetic isolated data. Name any required hosted writes before executing them.

## Existing verification starting points

- `tests/personal-pages-browser.cjs`
- `tests/connected-scorebook-browser.cjs`

Inspect each script's actual coverage and execution target first. These references do not claim all acceptance is already covered. Reuse focused checks; add a new regression only for meaningful uncovered changed behavior. Complete required CI before specifically approved delivery. Do not install or upgrade dependencies just to review the screen.

## Brief to complete with the owner

- Requested change, in their words: **Pending**.
- Desired visible result / screenshot reference: **Pending**.
- Existing behavior to retain: the screen contract and preservation rules above.
- Data or policy decisions needed: inspect first; flag only real dependencies.
- Review device: identify computer, real iPhone or both.
- Review version and navigation entry/exit: record explicitly.
- Scope exclusions or adjacent changes: state before implementation if material.

Do not invent preferences or adopt a larger feature proposal merely to fill this brief.

## Safe execution and approval boundaries

Continue authorized read-only inspection and reversible local work for the agreed screen. Preserve all unrelated local changes. Do not republish changes already merged.

Specific approval is required for commits, pushes/PRs, merge/deployment, live schema/auth/access changes, new services or paid actions. No hosted account/game/play/rule/invite mutation or test email is implied by a display review. Keep credentials/OTP and private records out of artifacts.

A green build or inactive upload is not a live release. Preserve required checks and Access. Never activate a version or weaken protections to make this screen review easier.

## Completion receipt — fill after the work, not now

1. Owner brief and exact delivered change.
2. Files changed; shared consumers checked.
3. Exact source/review target; focused validation links/results.
4. Desktop and real iPhone evidence separately; failures/untested limits.
5. Commit/branch/PR/merged SHA, if authorized; otherwise say local-only.
6. Candidate upload and actual active traffic, if relevant; activation approval.
7. Existing tracker evidence update status; no whole-milestone claim from a narrow check.
8. Scoped revert/rollback and stop conditions.
9. Owner acceptance or explicit hold; agreed next screen.

**Current outcome:** Documentation prepared only. No screen implementation, new acceptance pass or live release is claimed by this work package.
